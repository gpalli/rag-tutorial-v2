Sample Text Document

This is a sample text file to test the RAG system's ability to load and process plain text files.

The system now supports:
- PDF files (using PyPDFDirectoryLoader)
- Markdown files (using DirectoryLoader with TextLoader)
- Plain text files (using DirectoryLoader with TextLoader)

All file types are processed through the same pipeline:
1. Document loading
2. Text splitting into chunks
3. Vector embedding generation
4. Storage in Chroma database

This ensures consistent processing regardless of the input file format.
