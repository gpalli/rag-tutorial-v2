- 📊 **Dimension mismatch**: 768D vs 1024D vectors are incompatible

### **Commands to Switch Models**

```bash
# Switch to nomic-embed-text
python populate_database.py --reset --provider ollama --model nomic-embed-text
python query_data.py "Your question" --provider ollama --model nomic-embed-text

# Switch to mxbai-embed-large  
python populate_database.py --reset --provider ollama --model mxbai-embed-large
python query_data.py "Your question" --provider ollama --model mxbai-embed-large
```
